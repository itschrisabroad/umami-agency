## Browser support?

Pose and React Pose support all major browsers.

For IE11 support, a [polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from#Polyfill) for `Array.from` is necessary.

## Filesize?

As of version 3.0:

- Pose is **15.7kb**
- React Pose is **18.8kb**

## Server-side rendering?

Currently React Pose doesn't apply any styles on the server, and you may need to apply initial styles via your CSS solution.
